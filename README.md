# Credit Risk Classification with Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM

This repository contains the **Datamanz** project for credit risk classification on the German Credit dataset.  
We compare **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**, reporting accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, ROC/AUC, and variable importance.

## Objectives
1. Reproducible preprocessing and EDA.
2. Baseline model: Decision Tree (+ pruning and rules).
3. Ensembles: Random Forest (base and caret-tuned).
4. Margin-based model: SVM (caret, ROC/AUC).
5. Comparative evaluation and conclusions.
