# 📊 Credit Risk Classification with Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM

This repository contains the **Datamanz project** for credit risk classification on the German Credit dataset.  
We compare **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, reporting metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, ROC/AUC, and variable importance.  

---

## ✨ Project Objectives
- 🔍 Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key patterns.  
- 🌳 Build and prune **Decision Trees** for interpretability.  
- 🌲 Apply **Random Forest** for ensemble learning.  
- 🤖 Train **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for margin-based classification.  
- 📈 Evaluate models with **confusion matrices, metrics, and ROC curves**.
